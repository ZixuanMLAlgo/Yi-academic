Yi is an algorithm engineer contributing on ultilizing machine learning methods to solve realistic problems like autonomous driving, abnomoly detection and repetitive engineering design work. Before industrial experience, I have a good academic experience during MSc period with the supervision of Prof. Ravinder Dahiya in University of Glasgow Bendable Electronics and Sensing Technologies (BEST) group.

Throughout my career, I have strived to work alongside the best because I believe in the importance of peer learning.
